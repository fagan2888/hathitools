Tools for working with Hathi Trust Research Center extracted features files.

The HTRC extracted features files provide page-level word count data for ~15M volumes.
This package provides some simple tools for extracting information from these files about word usage.
These scripts are tested on a Mac and should work on linux, but will probably cause problems on Windows except through the bash subsystem.

To start, create a set of selected volume IDs from Hathi Trust.
One good option is the [Workset Builder 2.0](https://solr2.htrc.illinois.edu/solr-ef) search interface.
Construct a search, and then download "Volume Metadata" in JSON format.
As an example, I searched for volumes whose metadata contains `mexican war`.
The page will save as `htrc-metadata-export.json`.
The download may take a while, depending on the number of selected volumes.
Here is an example record from this file:

    {"htBibUrl":"http://catalog.hathitrust.org/api/volumes/full/htid/aeu.ark:/13960/t44q9g792.json","lastUpdateDate":"2014-09-18 03:45:48","isbn":["0665834071"],"imprint":"Yale University Press; Glasgow, Brook, 1921.","accessProfile":"open","language":"eng","typeOfResource":"text","title":"Texas and the Mexican War a chronicle of the winning of the Southwest / by Nathaniel W. Stephenson.","lccn":[],"dateCreated":"2016-06-19T07:39:10.5311367Z","enumerationChronology":" ","genre":["not fiction"],"pubPlace":"ctu","hathitrustRecordNumber":"100300175","schemaVersion":"1.3","sourceInstitutionRecordNumber":"","volumeIdentifier":"aeu.ark:/13960/t44q9g792","rightsAttributes":"pdus","classification":{"ddc":["976.4/04"]},"pubDate":"1921","governmentDocument":false,"sourceInstitution":"AEU","bibliographicFormat":"BK","names":["Stephenson, Nathaniel W. (Nathaniel Wright) 1867-1935 "],"issn":[],"handleUrl":"http://hdl.handle.net/2027/aeu.ark:/13960/t44q9g792","oclc":["564591684"],"issuance":"monographic"}

The script `bin/json2ids.py` reads this file and outputs a new file containing paths suitable for `rsync`.
It's based on examples from [this HTRC notebook](https://github.com/htrc/htrc-feature-reader/blob/master/examples/ID_to_Rsync_Link.ipynb).

    python bin/json2ids.py ~/Downloads/htrc-metadata-export.json > mexican_war_agenda.txt

The resulting file contains one line per volume. IDs are expanded to full paths using the "pairtree" method.

    aeu/pairtree_root/ar/k+/=1/39/60/=t/44/q9/g7/92/ark+=13960=t44q9g792/aeu.ark+=13960=t44q9g792.json.bz2
    aeu/pairtree_root/ar/k+/=1/39/60/=t/58/d0/rk/2g/ark+=13960=t58d0rk2g/aeu.ark+=13960=t58d0rk2g.json.bz2
    ...

I then download the extracted features files to a new directory.

    mkdir mexican_war
    rsync -av --no-relative --files-from mexican_war_agenda.txt data.analytics.hathitrust.org::features/ mexican_war

The files in this directory correspond to volumes in the workset.
Each file is a JSON file compressed using the `bzip2` method.

The next step is to convert the `.json.bz2` features files into something more readable.
My preferred file format is a three column tab-delimited file (this is the default for Mallet).
Since we do not have words in order in the extracted features file, it is difficult to get any useful information from high-frequency words like determiners, conjunctions, and prepositions.
I created a minimal stoplist in the file `stoplist.txt`, containing words that I will not record.
I am also dropping information about word frequency within pages, and only record that a word was present at least once.
For pages this is not a terrible approximation.

    python bin/bz_to_text.py mexican_war stoplist.txt > mexican_war.txt

Here's an example of the result:

    hvd.32044021238100	X	federals killed second defeated john success his too among force judging hill soon struck than march three himself breaking hasten engagement advancing what line troops captured fell must him battle opportune advanced wished came blow capturing before afterwards intended howard two  height accomplished reinforcements forward daylight early coming commanding troopers men then these overwhelmed they far resulted prisoners until division army wounded upon decisive now did gained driven colors dispositions just concentrated found through been pressing ewell also general being dayâ€”lee after engaged third sickles cemetery brigadier-generals longstreet back their moment heth routed pender reynolds formed brigades retreated exclusive fight divisions could bring archer federal sent general confederates gettysburg whole its cannon mainly two attack where get lee loss were several more union begun confederate joined rodes lines against word made moved when pushed possible one meade wish corps brilliant

I'm removing punctuation and all other non-Unicode-letter characters from the ends of words, but not from the middle. I'm also not removing ligatures, so fi and fl ligature characters may still be present.
The first field is the volume ID, which originated from Harvard libraries.
The `X` in the second field is a placeholder, since Mallet by default assumes there will be three columns in input files.

This file is fine for use with Mallet, but for matrix operations I have a slightly more compact format that represents word IDs as base 64 strings.
Base 64 is a binary format that represents numbers as printable letter characters.
To encode this file we first need to construct a vocabulary, which I limit to 65536 (ie 2<sup>16</sup>) entries.
This is large enough for most purposes but fits in two bytes, so we can print it in base 64 without a lot of wasted bits.

    python bin/text_vocab.py mexican_war.txt > vocab64.mexican_war

Words in this file are arranged in descending order by frequency. The top words are *his*, *were*, *they*, which are the most common words not appearing in my minimal stoplist.
Given this vocabulary mapping strings to numbers, I can now produce a compressed representation of the page token information.

    python bin/tokens_to_base64.py vocab64.mexican_war mexican_war.txt b64.mexican_war

The resulting output for the page we previously displayed is:

    hvd.32044021238100	X	HBHVB98LAw2mAdgAWAFaH+QBAQCQEQsAAwBQArECewAbBzUF8g0qAg8NoACOAW8D/B+rA98IUgD8DhwCDgGRAesBOwFrCA4AIwSHASQpoACoAikNvwCcBQAACwkDAIIDuwB/FLcCZwFeDhkBAwTwEycAEQCZAGbsCAhrBGEEJgBdAEgAiwP1AqsEdDS1ASEVIBGMAHo9QwAIABQEPQAHAIgUQd4xAEEAfgMDAUQBfQJNCFsAxAHhD2pSigk+E9ICRgChAKkBBQBwNN0JNQfwAWUD7QCnAQcAXgSXCnoA0RZPGWECEgASApMAywNOA64F5QBLAMsAbgBvAc0EAABZBkkBZAf9ACwA6AGLZRcEtw99ANcIMwCPCdwA1gV/BIw24AGQAI0GBgWLAQ==

The script `bin/multiply.py` produces a vector representation of each word in the vocabulary.
Technically this is an approximate eigenvector decomposition using 10 iterations of the iterated subspace algorithm.
It's equivalent to Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).

    python bin/multiply.py b64.mexican_war vocab64.mexican_war

The streaming matrix multiply is fairly efficient, but takes a while. For the 500-volume Mexican War collection it is done in about five minutes.
This script produces a file called `embeddings.txt`:

    his -0.17046289710428236 -0.048829368247665955 -0.00011366652487146231 -0.003885293511609003 -0.03100028748949623 -0.015697542606138114 0.0029981629387524677 -0.23378770551397143 -0.19732011191668974 0.021442434080682114...

This has one line for each word in the vocabulary, with a 100-dimensional representation of the word in vector space.
A convenient way to explore this vector space is to find k-means clusters.

    python bin/kmeans.py embeddings.txt 100

The resulting clusters are pretty coherent, to me. Words are presented in descending order by corpus frequency. Here are seven randomly selected ones:
